        <p>
          This Howto guide uses a hands-on approach to let you learn how to build
          a website using Hippo Site Toolkit step by step. It describes a number
          of small tasks that you will need to perform while building your website.
          You can either follow them all in chronological order, or go directly to the
          task you want to learn about.
