    <section name="Quickstart">
      <span class='shortdesc quickstart-48 icon-text-48'>Check it out yourself and install the quickstart demo site.</span>

      <p> 
        The HST2 Getting Started packages contain all the core components, and have been
        pre-configured with a number of modules and settings, to give you a quick overview of the
        HST2. 
      </p>
      
      <subsection name="Download">
        <p> 
          Two WAR packages are available for download. You can deploy them in either Tomcat or
          Jetty or any other servlet container that you prefer. Note: Hippo HST2 has not been
          released. The following downloads are snapshots of the current build. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class='rewrite'>For CMS the quickstart package is called quickstart and this one gettingstarted, while `hst' is not part of the package name. 
             I think all quickstart packages should have `quickstart' in their name and they also all should contain the project (product) name in their name.
             Or maybe there is some other consistent and clear naming scheme.
