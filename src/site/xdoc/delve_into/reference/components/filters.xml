        <subsection name="ModuleFilter">
          <p>The purpose of the ModuleFilter is to execute any bussineslogic defined in the module class.
             A module Class can have a specific method called <code>execute()</code>  that contains the businesslogic of that specific module.
             Setting the <code>execute</code> attribute on the module definition to <code>true</code> will trigger the ModuleRenderTag to set the Module in the ModuleRegistry. Once the action on the page is performed, the request will be handled by the ModuleFilter, which in it's turn will trigger the <code>execute</code> method of that specific module.
          </p>
