      <section name="HST2 Expression Language">
        <p>An HST2 web filter provides an object in request scope that is able to access the current pageNode.
          This object, by default identified by the name <em>pageNode</em>,  can easily be used from within a module jsp
          using JSP 2.0's standard JSTL Expression Language (or EL, <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/JSPIntro7.html" target="_blank">see here</a>).
          EL accesses objects through <code>${}</code> notation, and using dots <code>.</code> or square brackets
          <code>['']</code> to access nested objects and properties.</p>
