    <section name="The &lt;hst:encodeURL&gt; tag">
      <p><b>&lt;hst:encodeURL&gt;</b> encodes a repository path location to a URL valid for
        URL mapping functionality (<a href="../url-mapping.html">see here</a>)</p>

      <p>Following table shows the attributes of the tag. An attribute's value is first found by the
        directly available value, subsequently by a configuration key if present,
        then by a default value. A configuration key is a key in the configuration file normally
        called <code>hst.properties</code>, as given by a web.xml context parameter (<a
          href="../configuration.html">see here</a>).</p>
