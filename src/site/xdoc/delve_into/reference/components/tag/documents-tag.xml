    <section name="The &lt;hst:documents&gt; tag and derived tags">
      <p><b>&lt;hst:documents&gt;</b> tag, and it's derived tags <b>&lt;hst:news&gt;</b>, 
        <b>&lt;hst:events&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;hst:articles&gt;</b> show a list of documents, news items, 
        events or articles, respectively. Their basic functionality is more or less the same, 
        they differ in the fact that they have different default values and also may be configured
        differently.</p>
      
      <p>Following table shows the attributes of the tag. An attribute's value is first found by the
        directly available value, subsequently by a configuration key if present,
        then by a default value. A configuration key is a key in the configuration file normally
        called <code>hst.properties</code>, as given by a web.xml context parameter (<a
          href="../configuration.html">see here</a>).</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Attribute</th>
          <th>Required</th>
          <th>ConfigurationKey</th>
          <th>Default</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>context</td>
          <td>no</td>
          <td>&lt;tagname&gt;.context.name</td>
          <td>context</td>
          <td>The optional name by which to get a context object from request.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>location</td>
          <td>no</td>
          <td>&lt;tagname&gt;.location</td>
          <td>/documents, /news, /events, /articles</td>
          <td>The optional location, relative to the context, pointing to the documents
            node applicable.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>maxDocuments</td>
          <td>no</td>
          <td>&lt;tagname&gt;.max.documents</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>The optional variable name by which the encoded URL is set as request attribute. If
            given, no output is written to the jsp directly.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>id</td>
          <td>no</td>
          <td>-</td>
          <td>documentslist, newslist, eventslist, articleslist</td>
          <td>The optional id of this tag that reoccurs as id of the outer div tag of the default
            output. Also used to retrieve an instance based view file.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h4>File based configuration</h4>
      <p>Besides the tag attributes, other items can be configured in the configuration
        file. For sure you need to configure the names of the properties to show
        for the documents. In short:</p>
      <source><![CDATA[<tagname>.document.properties
Comma separated list of document properties to shown. 
        
<tagname>.document.property.types=link,date,string
Comma separated list of property types that are applicable for the above properties. 
Defines how the properties are output by default.
              
<tagname>.document.exclude.names=index
Comma separated list of names of documents that are excluded from the list, 
like files called 'index'. 
                
<tagname>.document.viewfile
Location of a custom jsp file that is used for outputting documents, thereby 
overriding the default output.]]></source>
