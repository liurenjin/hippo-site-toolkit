      <section name="Serving binaries with the BinariesServlet">
        <p>
          The HST2 contains a servlet for serving binaries, e.g. a gif image or a pdf document, which are stored in the repository.
          The servlet should be installed in your web.xml, 
          see <a href="configuration.html#BinariesServlet">configuration</a>.
        </p>
        
        <subsection name="How does it work?">
          <p>
             All data in Hippo Repository is stored as property of a certain node. 
             The BinariesServlet will look for a node in the repository based on the URL it gets.
          </p>
          <p>If above node and properties are found, the servlet will fetch the asset from the repository and:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>set the found mime type to the response</li>
            <li>write the property as stream to the response</li>
          </ul>
        </subsection>
        <subsection name="Usage">
            <p>It is common use to access the BinariesServlet in the <code>src</code> attribute of
              a <code>img</code> tag, or in the <code>href</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> tag.</p>
            <p>The path to the binary node in the repository should be easily obtained using the
              <code>resourceUrl</code> property of your current item. 
              In the following example <code>hippo:resource</code> is a subnode of the current pageNode:</p>
          <source><![CDATA[  web.xml setup: BinariesServlet has URL-pattern /binaries/*
  
  using expression language:
          
  <c:if test="${contentNode.resourceUrl['project:image'] != null}">
      <img src="${contentNode.resourceUrl['project:image']}"/>
  </c:if>
