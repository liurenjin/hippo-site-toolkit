          <p>
            In regular jsp site development, the browser goes to a jsp by means of the URL and
            the page retrieves the repository content and presents it. 
            The HST2's URL mapping functionality reverses this process: the URL configured in the HST2, describes the location of the repository content and
            determines it's view. </p>
          <p>For example, a <i>content URL</i> showing a news item would look like
            <code>/myapp/news/new-version-released</code>, whereas a <i>page URL</i> with parameters would look like
            <code>/myapp/news/newsItem.jsp?item=1</code>.</p>
          <p>Having content URL instead of page URL has the benefits of being <i>readable</i> and
              <i>bookmarkable</i>.</p>
