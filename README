How to test and build Hippo Site Toolkit
========================================

1. Introduction

  Very brief introduction to how to build, test and run HST!

2. Requirements --

  (1) Java 1.6
  (2) Maven 2.2.1 or higher
  (3) [Optional] Tomcat 6.0 or higher if you want to deploy and run on Tomcat.)

3. Build 
     
    (1) Build with testing
    
      $ mvn clean install
    
    (2) Build with skipping tests
    
      $ mvn clean install -DskipTests 
    
4. Creating the mvn site with javadocs: type from the root
   $ mvn -o site     
   
   All aggregated javadocs are generated in target/site/apidocs and all aggregated test javadocs are generated in target/site/testapidocs.

   In addition, "The User API JavaDocs", which includes only api, mock, commons, content-beans and client, are generated in target/site/userapidocs/ separately.
   Also, a menu link item for "The User API JavaDocs" has been added in site.xml. 
   
   Use 
   
   $ mvn -o site:stage 
   
   If you want to see sub-module links in your generated site, also see
