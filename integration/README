The integration tests reside in the tests module, the war module contains a web application
that must be started before the integration tests are run. Tests connect to the remote repository over RMI.
The test suite itself also starts up a repository that is clustered against the same database.

To execute all integration tests at once, change to the tests directory and run:
$ mvn -Pintegration
This will automatically start cargo and deploy the clustered repository. The integration suite is then
run and finally cargo is stopped again.

For fast development you can also start cargo in standalone mode and run individual tests from your IDE.
Change to the tests directory and run:
$ mvn -Pcargo.run
