title: Manage your building blocks

add.label: Add new building block
intro: <p>A building block is a region design that is not a complete page and that has a name of its own, which you may invent. A region design may use any building block by referring to it by its name. The set of building blocks offers a library of region designs that each may be used in many page designs. This may occur via many levels of containers. Page designs can be selected in URL designs, while building blocks can not.</p><p><br/>To the left you see a folder tree. Each upper level folder is a building block. The name of the folder is the name of the building block. Each sub folder is a region design to fill a container. This is exactly the same as for page designs. The name of a sub folder equals the name of a container. You may not invent that name yourself. You will be presented a list of allowed names to choose from. The names are references to the containers that are specified in the template of the parent folder. Templates are one type of ingredients you can choose to define region designs.</p>
