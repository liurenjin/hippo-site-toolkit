add.label: Add new web page design
intro: <p>A Web page design defines how information is presented on each web page that is generated by that design. The actual information on these pages will be different. A web page design has a name by which it can be selected in a URL design. You may invent names for page designs yourself.</p><p><br/>To the left you see a folder tree. Each upper level folder is a page design. The name of the folder is the name of the page design. Each sub folder is a region design to fill a container. The name of a sub folder equals the name of a container. You may not invent that name yourself. You will be presented a list of allowed names to choose from. The names are references to the containers that are specified in the template of the parent folder. Templates are one type of ingredients you can choose to define region designs.</p>
