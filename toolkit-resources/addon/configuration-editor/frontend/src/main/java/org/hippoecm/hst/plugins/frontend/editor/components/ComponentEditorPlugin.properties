intro: <p>A region design can reference another region design. Then all ingredients from the referenced region design are reused here. You can add more parameters to fine tune the region design.</p><p>Otherwise, you specify a component class name and a template. The component class defines what information is shown in the region and the template defines how that information is shown in the region (the layout and the looks). If no special information is required, you can leave the component class name empty. A default will be used.</p><p>Some component classes can be fine tuned by parameters. You can add the parameters below. The possible names and values of the parameters depend on the component class.</p><p>Add an annotation to this region design for future reference! 1) Type a description. 2) In your browser, go to the site, make a screenshot of a region designed by this design and upload it as a thumbnail. In that way site configurators will see at a glance what your design is for.</p>
