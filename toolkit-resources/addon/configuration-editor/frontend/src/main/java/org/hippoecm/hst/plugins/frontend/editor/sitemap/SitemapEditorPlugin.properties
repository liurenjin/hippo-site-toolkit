title: Manage URL designs
intro: <p>A URL ('uniform resource locator') is an address for a web page. With a URL design you configure what URL is used as address for what web page.</p><p>URL design involves selection of destination content and selection of a page design. The actual web page that is the destination for the URL presents the destination content according to the page design.</p><p>URL design would become very tedious if every single URL had to be coupled to a web page. To ease the URL design, patterns can be used to configure many URLs in a single design rule.</p><p><br/>To the left you see a folder tree. Each folder and each sub folder is a URL design. The name of each folder and sub folder is a level pattern. A level pattern with all level patterns of previous levels in front of it is a pattern for a complete URL.</p>
